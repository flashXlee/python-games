# Learning Python with games
Sami's personal projects
The games are from `Python games for kids` book, though i have improved on them

## How to use
- for all my fun games you need to have `python 3` installed.
- Install Pygame
```
pip3 install pygame
```

- Install Pygame zero
```
pip3 install pgzero
```
